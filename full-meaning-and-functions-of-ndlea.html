Since then, illicit drug trafficking has evolved into an organized criminal enterprise that jeopardizes the country’s security and growth, necessitating the government’s immediate attention and priority.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-full-meaning-of-ndlea></span><strong>What is the full meaning of NDLEA?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>NDLEA stands for National Drug Law Enforcement Agency.

The establishment was done through the proclamation of decree No. 48, which is now an act of parliament, with the primary goal of eliminating illicit drug trafficking and usage in Nigerian society.</p><p>The NDLEA is divided into 14 directorates, 14 zonal commands, 111 city area commands, and 10 Special (airports and seaports) commands. They have a presence in all of the country’s airports, seaports, border posts, and critical places throughout the country’s road networks.</p><p>The Agency goes with the vision of becoming Africa’s most effective and pioneering drug law enforcement agency, as well as one of the best in the world, and to contribute to the formation and management of Nigeria’s positive view.

Here are some of the functions of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency of Nigeria:</p><h4><strong>1. Enforcement of Drug and other Psychotic substances Laws in Nigeria</strong></h4><p>The NDLEA has been tasked with enforcing drug regulations that everyone must follow; anyone found guilty of drug trafficking will also face severe penalties under the law. However, other authorities outside the NDLEA prosecute drug laws; as a result, the NDLEA collaborates with these agencies to combat drug trafficking in Nigeria.</p><h4><strong>2. Tracking down Drug Traffickers</strong></h4><p>The NDLEA operates at airports and other border crossing locations to check for and investigate cases of drug trafficking by people entering and leaving the country. The agency collaborates with other international drug agencies to combat the drug trade.</p><p>International drug organizations also contribute crucial information during narcotics trafficking investigations. They also make preventative efforts to combat the illegal trafficking of hard substances like marijuana, cocaine, and opioids in Nigeria.</p><h4><strong>3. The Agency Investigates Financial Proceeds Made From Drug Business</strong></h4><p>The NDLEA not only pursues drug traffickers but also investigates their financial transactions. The proceeds from the sale of illegal substances are seized, and the perpetrators face legal consequences.</p><h4><strong>4. The Agency Aids Drug Research in the Country</strong></h4><p>One of the NDLEA’s most notable responsibilities is drug research. The NDLEA, in partnership with other foreign agencies, plays a significant role in drug research in Nigeria. With scientific technology and resources at their disposal, they help identify the majority of these drugs, such as stimulants and hallucinogens, and comprehend the consequences of these drugs on Nigerians’ health and social lives.</p><h4><strong>5. The Employe Awareness Strategies to Educate the Public</strong></h4><p>The organization also uses different tools to raise public awareness about the hazards of drug trafficking and its implications for human health. One of the tools they use is awareness programs to educate young people about the dangers of using hard drugs and substances. More emphasis is placed on the psychological and physiological impacts of these harsh substances on the body.</p><h4><strong>6. Punishment of Illegal Drug Traffickers in Nigeria</strong></h4><p>Those found guilty of transporting drugs or growing narcotics in Nigeria are arrested and prosecuted. They impose penalties on individuals caught in the act, as this is one of the agency’s most essential functions in Nigeria.&nbsp;In most cases, the agency target the organization that coordinates this drug trafficking and ensures they face legal actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ6lobluucSapaKml2Kur7CMn6ynm6SevK%2B%2FjKidZqaUobKiew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html&text=Full%20Meaning%20and%20Functions%20of%20NDLEA&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html&title=Full%20Meaning%20and%20Functions%20of%20NDLEA" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html&title=Full%20Meaning%20and%20Functions%20of%20NDLEA" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html&title=Full%20Meaning%20and%20Functions%20of%20NDLEA" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffull-meaning-and-functions-of-ndlea.html&description=Full%20Meaning%20and%20Functions%20of%20NDLEA" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./allison-rochell-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Allison Rochell?
