Is it?</p><p>The athlete is currently living with his girlfriend, Morgan Eudy, and has stepped up to be the stepfather of Eudy’s daughter from a previous relationship.</p><p>His roles as a partner and Father are quite debatable, being the guy who fled away from his responsibilities and filed for divorce when pregnant Venessa Morgan needed him the most.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing about his relationship with Eudy, the couple is now engaged and head over heels in love with each other.

However, she announced it to the netizens on <span>July 25, 2021</span>, through an Instagram post.</p><p>The couple had gotten engaged six months before their wedding, which took place at Mooney Falls in Arizona. In July 2019, Venessa referred to Kopech as her “forever” on social media.</p><p>Well, who knew ‘forever’ would only last 11 months from the engagement date? Venessa and Kopech were married from January to June of 2021, just for five months.</p><p>Their marriage came to an end when Michael Kopech silently filed for divorce on <span>June 19, 2020, </span>right after his wife found out about her pregnancy.</p><p>We are not in the place to judge, but even his little baby couldn’t stop the athlete from being away from his wife at her most vulnerable time.</p><p>Following her breakup with Kopech, the new mother also shared ultrasound photos and photos from the set of “Riverdale.”</p><p>Morgan continued to share updates about her pregnancy on social media, referring to her son as a “lil kicker.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=michael-kopech-personal-life-parents-and-family></span>Michael Kopech Personal Life: Parents And Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Michael Kopech was born on <span>April 30, 1996</span>, in Mount Pleasant, Texas, to <span>Michael P.
